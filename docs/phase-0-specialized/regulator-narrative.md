## Purpose

Quietly reassure cities, NGOs, auditors, and risk-averse partners.

## Key Narrative

*"Here's how a municipal auditor could reconstruct an entire procurement process without asking permission, without special access, and without anyone knowing they looked."*

## Outline

### The Auditor's Problem Today
- Records scattered across organizations
- Access requires permission (and politics)
- Reconstruction takes months
- Evidence can be altered before review

### What Changes with Cryptographic Accountability
- Every action is signed by a verifiable identity
- Records are tamper-evident
- Reconstruction is self-service
- No special access required

### Why This Is Better Than Surveillance
- Privacy preserved: only see what's relevant
- No central database to breach
- Accountability without monitoring
- Trust through verification, not observation

### What This Means for Regulators
- Lower compliance costs for small organizations
- Faster, cheaper audits
- Evidence that holds up
- Corruption detection built into the system
