## Purpose

Make the strongest technical differentiator accessible to community builders.

## Outline

### Why Centralized Workflows Fail Across Organizations
- The "whose database?" problem
- When collaboration requires surrender
- Why integrations break at organization boundaries

### How Agreements Can Still Move Forward Without a Shared System
- The inbox model: receive, verify, act
- State as local knowledge, not global truth
- Why you don't need to see the same screen

### Why Independence Actually Improves Cooperation
- Autonomy reduces coordination costs
- No more waiting for the slowest participant
- Resilience through redundancy

### The Canonical Flow: Offer → Accept → Disclose → Attest
- **Offer:** "Here's what I propose"
- **Accept:** "I agree to these terms"
- **Disclose:** "Here's what you need to verify"
- **Attest:** "I confirm this happened"

Each step is:
- Signed by the party taking action
- Verifiable by anyone who needs to know
- Independent of any central system
