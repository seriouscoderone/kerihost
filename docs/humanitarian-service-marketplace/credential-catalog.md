## Credential Details

### State-Endorsed Digital Identity (`sedi_identity`)

**Description:** Government-issued digital identity credential backed by KERI protocols. The gold standard root of identity. Utah is leading adoption with multi-state expansion underway. Apple and Google wallets in talks for integration. Provides the foundational identity that all other credentials reference.

**Issuer role:** government_agency
**Holder role:** individual
**Verifier roles:** service_platform, grassroots_org, kyv_provider, credential_provider, government_agency
**Disclosure mode:** selective

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `legal_name` | string | yes | Legal name of the individual |
| `date_of_birth` | date | yes | Date of birth |
| `jurisdiction` | string | yes | Issuing state or jurisdiction |
| `sedi_id` | string | yes | State-endorsed digital identity number |
| `address` | string | no | Residential address |
| `photo_hash` | string | no | Hash of photo for biometric matching |

#### Privacy Notes

- Supports selective disclosure via ACDC graduated disclosure. Verifiers receive only the fields they request.
- Holder can prove possession without revealing attribute values (compact disclosure).
- A volunteer matching a service need may only need to prove "is a verified person in this jurisdiction" without revealing name, address, or date of birth.

---

### Know Your Volunteer Credential (`kyv_credential`)

**Description:** Composable credential attesting that a volunteer has been vetted to a specific standard. Built from component credentials (background checks, training certs, psych evals, etc.). Multiple KYV standards coexist — each with different compositions and trust levels. The ACDC chaining makes the composition transparent so verifiers can see exactly what went into it.

**Issuer role:** kyv_provider
**Holder role:** individual
**Verifier roles:** service_platform, grassroots_org, individual
**Disclosure mode:** selective

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `kyv_standard_said` | string | yes | SAID of the KYV standard this credential satisfies |
| `vetting_date` | date | yes | Date the vetting was completed |
| `expiration_date` | date | yes | When the KYV credential expires and requires renewal |
| `component_credentials` | string[] | yes | SAIDs of component credentials that compose this KYV |
| `verification_methods` | string[] | yes | Methods used (in-person, background check, training, etc.) |
| `in_person_verified` | boolean | yes | Whether in-person verification was part of the vetting |

#### Credential Chaining

This credential chains from `background_check`. The issuer MUST hold a valid, unrevoked `background_check` credential. The edge block (`e`) of this ACDC references the chained credential's SAID, creating a cryptographically verifiable provenance chain.

#### Privacy Notes

- Supports selective disclosure via ACDC graduated disclosure. Verifiers receive only the fields they request.
- A service requester may only need to verify "has valid KYV" without seeing which components were checked.
- Component credential details are available to verifiers who need deeper assurance.

---

### Skill/Training Certificate (`skill_credential`)

**Description:** Credential issued by a training provider, trade school, or licensing body attesting to a specific skill or qualification. CPR certification, electrical license, painting certification, medical training, harassment awareness, etc. The issuing entity is also the verifier.

**Issuer role:** credential_provider
**Holder role:** individual
**Verifier roles:** service_platform, grassroots_org, individual, kyv_provider
**Disclosure mode:** full

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `skill_name` | string | yes | Name of the skill or certification |
| `skill_category` | string | yes | Category (medical, trade, safety, etc.) |
| `issuing_institution` | string | yes | Name of the issuing training provider |

- Transparency in commitments builds trust and enables dispute resolution.

---

### Proof of Service (`proof_of_service`)

**Description:** Automated or manual proof that service was rendered. Multi-modal verification: geolocation + barometric + biometric (phone KEL logs), digital tool interaction logs, or manual sponsor attestation. Each method produces a different verification strength.
