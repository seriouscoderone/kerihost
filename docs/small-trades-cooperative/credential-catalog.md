## Credential Details

### Trade License (`trade_license`)

**Description:** State-issued license to practice a specific trade (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, welding, carpentry, concrete, etc.). The entry floor — a valid license means you can work today, regardless of experience level.

**Issuer role:** licensing_board
**Holder role:** tradesperson
**Verifier roles:** homeowner, city_building_dept, coop, inspector
**Disclosure mode:** Selective

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `trade_category` | string | Yes | Trade type (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, etc.) |
| `license_number` | string | Yes | State-issued license identifier |

| `restrictions` | string[] | No | Any restrictions on the license |

#### Privacy Notes

- Supports selective disclosure via ACDC graduated disclosure. Verifiers receive only the fields they request.
- Holder can prove possession without revealing attribute values (compact disclosure).
- Typical presentation: prove licensed=yes and trade_category without revealing license_number.

---

### Insurance Coverage (`insurance_credential`)

**Issuer role:** insurance ecosystem (interoperability bridge)
**Holder role:** tradesperson
**Verifier roles:** homeowner, city_building_dept, coop
**Disclosure mode:** Selective

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|

- Replaces faxed certificates — one credential, always current, verifiable by anyone.

---

### Surety Bond (`bond_credential`)

**Description:** Proof of surety bond for larger jobs. Guarantees financial recourse if work is not completed. In the mature ecosystem, escrow may replace most bonding needs for smaller jobs.

**Issuer role:** surety ecosystem (interoperability bridge)
**Holder role:** tradesperson
**Verifier roles:** homeowner, city_building_dept
**Disclosure mode:** Selective

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |

---

### Background Check (`background_check`)

**Description:** Pass/fail background check. No underlying details disclosed — the credential says "cleared" not "here's the report." Issued once, held by the worker, verifiable by any coop without re-running the check.

**Issuer role:** issuing agency (interoperability bridge)
**Holder role:** tradesperson
**Verifier roles:** coop
**Disclosure mode:** Selective

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |

- Coop sees pass/fail. Homeowner sees "coop member" which implies background check passed.

---

### Drug Screening (`drug_test`)

**Description:** Pass/fail drug screening result. Disclosed to coop membership verification only — homeowners see "coop member" which implies the coop's requirements are met. Worker controls further disclosure.

**Issuer role:** testing facility
**Holder role:** tradesperson
**Verifier roles:** coop
**Disclosure mode:** Selective

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|

**Issuer role:** licensing_board / master_tradesperson
**Holder role:** tradesperson
**Verifier roles:** homeowner, coop, inspector
**Disclosure mode:** Full

#### Schema Fields

#### Privacy Notes

- Full disclosure: all schema fields are revealed to verifiers on presentation.

---

### Apprenticeship Attestation (`apprenticeship_attestation`)

**Description:** Issued by a master tradesperson to their apprentice. Records scope of training, duration, and the mentor's identity. Creates a verifiable lineage — who trained you, who trained them. The mentor's reputation flows to the apprentice. Alternative to formal trade school path. Mentor stakes their reputation on the apprentice's competence.

**Issuer role:** master_tradesperson
**Holder role:** apprentice
**Verifier roles:** homeowner, coop, licensing_board
**Disclosure mode:** Full

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |

#### Privacy Notes

- Full disclosure: all schema fields are revealed to verifiers on presentation.
- The lineage IS the value — transparency of mentorship chain builds trust.

---

### Master Designation (`master_designation`)

**Description:** Recognized master-level practitioner in a specific trade. Issued by the licensing board. Authorizes the holder to mentor apprentices and issue apprenticeship attestations. In the mature ecosystem, a master with strong reputation becomes a trust anchor independent of institutional backing.

**Issuer role:** licensing_board
**Holder role:** master_tradesperson
**Verifier roles:** all
**Disclosure mode:** Full

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|

---

### Cooperative Membership (`coop_membership`)

**Description:** Active member of a specific cooperative. Implies the coop's published membership requirements are met — background check, drug test, insurance minimums, whatever the coop demands. The coop's brand and requirements ARE the value of membership. Worker presents this instead of individual screening credentials to homeowners.

**Issuer role:** coop
**Holder role:** tradesperson
**Verifier roles:** homeowner, connector_service
**Disclosure mode:** Full

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|

#### Privacy Notes

- Full disclosure: all schema fields are revealed to verifiers on presentation.
- The coop membership credential is the homeowner's shorthand — "this person meets these standards" without needing to verify each standard individually.

---

### Coop Governance Framework (`coop_governance_framework`)

**Description:** Public document of membership requirements and standards. The coop publishes this so homeowners can see what "member of XYZ Coop" actually means. Different coops have different requirements — this is how they differentiate. Premium coops demand more; budget coops demand the legal minimum. Both are transparent.

**Issuer role:** coop
**Holder role:** coop (self-published)

**Disclosure mode:** Full

### Job Completion Attestation (`job_completion_attestation`)

**Description:** The atomic unit of reputation. Homeowner attests that a specific job was completed by a specific tradesperson. Not a review — just a fact. Signed as part of contract close-out with zero extra effort. Friends and neighbors see it and ask for recommendations through the relationship, not through a platform. Workers accumulate these as portable, verifiable work history.

**Issuer role:** homeowner
**Holder role:** tradesperson

**Disclosure mode:** Full

---

### Financial Responsibility (`financial_responsibility`)

**Description:** Proof that the homeowner can fund escrow for a given amount. Financial institution attests fundability without revealing bank balance, account details, or any other financial information. The tradesperson sees "escrow fundable to $X" — that's it.

**Issuer role:** licensing_board / city_building_dept
**Holder role:** inspector
**Verifier roles:** city_building_dept, homeowner, tradesperson
**Disclosure mode:** Full

#### Privacy Notes

- Full disclosure: all schema fields are revealed to verifiers on presentation.

---

### Mediator Credential (`mediator_credential`)

**Disclosure mode:** Contractual

#### Privacy Notes

- Contractual disclosure only. Access limited to named parties and escrow service.
- Ruling details are not public. Only the existence of mediation (and that it was resolved) may be inferred.

---

### Escrow Contract (`escrow_contract`)

**Description:** Funds locked between contract signing and job completion. Defines release conditions, milestone schedule, mediator designation, and mediator fee. Both parties sign before work begins. Cross-ecosystem primitive — this pattern applies to any service contract.

- Financial details never exposed beyond the contract scope.

---

### Escrow Release (`escrow_release`)

**Description:** Funds released — either clean close (mutual attestation) or mediated ruling. The release record shows outcome type but not amounts. A tradesperson with many clean releases has a strong reputation signal.

**Issuer role:** escrow_service
**Holder role:** tradesperson
**Verifier roles:** homeowner, coop, connector_service
**Disclosure mode:** Selective

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|

| `release_date` | date | Yes | Date funds were released |
| `clean_release` | boolean | Yes | Whether release was dispute-free |

#### Credential Chaining

This credential chains from `escrow_contract`. The issuer MUST hold a valid, unrevoked `escrow_contract` credential. The edge block (`e`) of this ACDC references the chained credential's SAID, creating a cryptographically verifiable provenance chain.

---

### Witnessed Recording (`witnessed_recording`)

**Description:** Hardware-attested photo or video of work, timestamped, geolocated, and witnessed by KERI witnesses. Locked box — existence is known, content is encrypted, access requires credentialed adjudicator and dispute trigger defined in contract. The existence of the recording is itself a deterrent. Both parties can create witnessed recordings.

**Issuer role:** device_attestor (via attested device)
**Holder role:** recording party (tradesperson or homeowner)
**Verifier roles:** mediator, inspector (dispute only)
**Disclosure mode:** Contractual

#### Privacy Notes

- Contractual disclosure only. Content encrypted at rest.
- Access requires dispute trigger + credentialed adjudicator.
- Existence of recording is visible; content is locked box.
- Chain-link confidentiality — disclosure gates open only on defined conditions.

---

### Hardware Device Attestation (`hardware_attestation`)

**Description:** Certifies that a device produces authentic, unmodified media. Manufacturer or certifier attests to the device's integrity. Enables the physical-to-digital bridge — without this, photos and videos have no cryptographic provenance.

---

### Connector Registration (`connector_registration`)

**Description:** Registration for a recommendation/matching service. Self-attested or coop-attested. Deliberately lightweight — connectors are optional, replaceable, and must not accumulate power over reputation data.

**Issuer role:** coop / self-attested
**Holder role:** connector_service
**Verifier roles:** homeowner, tradesperson
**Disclosure mode:** Full

#### Schema Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
