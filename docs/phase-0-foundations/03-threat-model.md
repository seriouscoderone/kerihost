## Purpose

Identify and design against the failure modes that would corrupt the mission.

## Outline

### 1. Capture
One entity quietly becomes the center.

**Defenses:**
- Easy exit
- Multiple witnesses
- Forkable infrastructure
- No exclusive credentials

### 2. Centralization
Convenience causes everyone to rely on one place.

**Defenses:**
- Always show alternatives
- Actively promote self-hosting
- Celebrate others doing it better

### 3. Wallet Hell
Incompatible wallets and tools.

**Defenses:**
- Interoperability standards
- Minimal UX assumptions
- Don't brand wallets as identity

### 4. Foundation Dominance
The non-profit becomes "the voice of truth."

**Defenses:**
- Curate don't decide
- No endorsements
- Public disagreement is okay
