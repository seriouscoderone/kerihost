## 1. Executive Summary

The Genealogy Ecosystem trust framework establishes a KERI-native governance model for the family history research industry. It replaces centralized platform trust (Ancestry, MyHeritage, 23andMe) with cryptographically verifiable relationships using Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs), Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs), and consensus-based authority.

The core principle: **the ecosystem does not certify truth -- it makes provenance visible.** Every research claim, record digitization, and identity resolution is a signed assertion by an identified participant. Trust emerges from the visible balance of endorsements and disputes, not from a gatekept stamp of approval. Individuals curate their own genealogy view by choosing which claims to accept.

**Scope:** Restructures family history research around cryptographically verifiable relationships between people, records, and evidence. Individuals own their research as portable, signed artifacts that carry provenance from source archives through researchers to families. The ecosystem eliminates the need to trust any single platform by making the evidence itself trustworthy.

**Regulatory basis:** State genetic privacy laws, GINA, state adoption record sealing statutes, state vital records access laws, GDPR (where applicable), indigenous/tribal records sovereignty, copyright law for digitized expressions.

## 2. Governance Authority

### 2.1 Governing Body

The Genealogy Ecosystem has no central governing body. Governance is emergent -- participants choose which issuers, researchers, and certification bodies to trust based on their visible track records. This reflects the industry reality: no single organization has authority over all genealogical knowledge.

Standards (shared schemas, protocol versions, infrastructure requirements) are maintained through open community processes. Schema adoption is organic -- schemas that prove useful gain adoption; those that don't are abandoned. The ecosystem provides the framework for interoperability; it does not mandate participation or enforce compliance.

### 2.2 Regulatory Frameworks

- **State genetic privacy laws (Maryland, Montana, California, Utah, Arizona)** -- require consent for genetic data disclosure and warrants for law enforcement access
- **GINA (Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act)** -- prohibits genetic discrimination in employment and health insurance
- **State adoption record sealing statutes** -- govern access to adoption records by jurisdiction
- **State vital records access laws** -- govern access to birth, death, and marriage records
- **GDPR** -- applies where European data subjects are involved
- **Indigenous/tribal records sovereignty requirements** -- tribal nations control access to their cultural and genealogical records
- **Copyright law for digitized record expressions** -- facts are not copyrightable; specific expressions (photographs, scans) may be

The ecosystem does not enforce these regulations. ACDCs can encode legal constraints (e.g., "sealed per state statute until 2075"), and the signed audit trail provides evidence for external legal proceedings. Individuals are responsible for their own legal compliance.

### 2.3 Framework Versioning

This trust framework is versioned. Changes to credential schemas, role definitions, or delegation rules require a new version published to the ecosystem's schema registry. Participants MUST verify framework version before issuing or accepting credentials.

### 3.2 Role Details

#### Archive (`archive`)

**Description:** Custodian of original physical records. Root authority in the provenance chain. Examples: county courthouses, churches, national archives, libraries, historical societies. Issues record custody credentials and authorizes digitization of their collections.

**Governance obligations:**
- Maintain witness pool with >= 3 witnesses for high-value attestations
- Publish OOBI endpoints for record custody credential verification
- Revoke digitization authorizations when terms are violated

**Credentials issued:** record_custody, digitization_authorization
**Credentials required to participate:** none (root authority)

---

#### Digitizer (`digitizer`)

**Description:** Creates digital copies of physical records. Ranges from professional scanning companies to individual volunteers photographing gravestones (e.g., Findagrave contributors). Issues digitization record credentials with provenance back to the source object.

**Governance obligations:**
- Digitization credentials must reference the source object
- Must disclose capture method and conditions (scan resolution, photo angle, etc.)
- Must honor copyright terms of digitization authorizations

**Credentials issued:** digitization_record, source_link
**Credentials required to participate:** none (digitization_authorization optional but strengthens provenance)

---

#### Indexer (`indexer`)

**Description:** Transcribes and tags digitized records to make them searchable. May be volunteers (like FamilySearch indexers), professionals, or AI services. Issues index entry credentials linking transcribed data to digitization records.

**Governance obligations:**
- Index entries must reference the digitization record they were derived from
- Must disclose transcription method (manual, AI-assisted, fully automated)

**Credentials issued:** index_entry
**Credentials required to participate:** none

---

#### Record Attestor (`record_attestor`)

**Description:** Verifies the fidelity of a digital copy to its physical original. May be an archive employee, a certified records examiner, or a trusted third party. Issues record attestation credentials that strengthen the provenance chain.

**Governance obligations:**
- Must have examined or compared the digital copy against the physical original
- Must disclose the basis of attestation (in-person comparison, authorized proxy, etc.)

**Credentials issued:** record_attestation
**Credentials required to participate:** none

---

#### Record Host (`record_host`)

**Description:** Stores and serves digital record copies. The decentralized replacement for Ancestry/MyHeritage hosting. Anyone can be a record host -- individuals, companies, nonprofits. Heaviest infrastructure role due to content serving at scale.

**Governance obligations:**
- Maintain witness pool with >= 3 witnesses
- Subscribe to watcher network for KEL sync and duplicity detection
- Honor hosting agreement terms (access controls, copyright restrictions)
- Publish OOBI endpoints for hosted collections

**Credentials issued:** none
**Credentials required to participate:** hosting_agreement

---

#### Researcher (`researcher`)

**Description:** Interprets records and makes claims about people and relationships. Ranges from professional genealogists to hobbyists. Issues research claims, identity resolution claims, disputes, and endorsements. Reputation emerges from visible claim history -- not from a gatekept certification.

**Governance obligations:**
- Research claims must reference supporting evidence (digitization records, index entries, etc.)
- Identity resolution claims must state the basis for linking records to the same person

**Credentials issued:** research_claim, identity_resolution, source_link, dispute_claim, endorsement
**Credentials required to participate:** none (professional_certification optional but carries organic weight)

---

#### Individual (`individual`)

**Description:** Person researching their own family history. Curates a personal genealogy view by accepting or rejecting research claims from others. Owns their research graph, DNA results, and identity links. Lightest infrastructure role -- just an agent to manage their personal view.

**Governance obligations:**
- Responsible for own key security and backup

**Credentials issued:** dispute_claim, endorsement
**Credentials required to participate:** none

---

#### Certification Body (`certification_body`)

**Description:** Issues professional credentials for genealogists. Includes certification boards (e.g., Board for Certification of Genealogists), universities, genealogy institutes, and training programs. Authority is organic and reputation-based -- the ecosystem does not anoint any single body.

**Governance obligations:**
- Maintain witness pool with >= 3 witnesses for credential issuance
- Publish criteria for certification and accreditation
- Revoke certifications when standards are not maintained

**Credentials issued:** professional_certification, program_accreditation
**Credentials required to participate:** none (authority is reputation-based)

---

#### Algorithm Service (`algorithm_service`)

**Description:** Provides corroboration scoring, matching, search indexing, and hint generation over the public claim graph. The decentralized replacement for Ancestry's matching algorithm. Competitive service layer -- anyone can build one. Reads the claim graph via watcher network, computes scores, and presents simplified views.

**Governance obligations:**
- Subscribe to watcher network for claim graph access
- Disclose scoring methodology (open or proprietary)

**Credentials issued:** none
**Credentials required to participate:** none

---

#### DNA Service (`dna_service`)

**Description:** Processes genetic samples and issues DNA result credentials held by the individual, not stored by the platform. Includes ethnicity estimates and kinship matches. Results are selective disclosure -- the individual controls what is revealed and to whom.

**Governance obligations:**
- Maintain witness pool with >= 3 witnesses for DNA credential issuance
- DNA result credentials must be issued to the individual, not retained by the service
- Must support selective disclosure for all DNA credentials
- Must comply with applicable genetic privacy laws

**Credentials issued:** dna_result, ethnicity_estimate, kinship_match
**Credentials required to participate:** none

---

## 4. Credential Governance

### 4.1 Issuance Rules

Each credential type has designated issuer roles. Only AIDs operating in the appropriate role may issue that credential type. Issuance MUST:

- Validate the issuer operates in the designated role
- Verify schema compliance before signing
- Anchor the TEL issuance event in the issuer's KEL
- Collect witness receipts meeting the ecosystem's threshold (for roles with witness pools)

For credentials without chaining requirements (most credentials in this ecosystem), the issuer's identity and visible track record are the basis of trust. For chained credentials (digitization_authorization, hosting_agreement, ethnicity_estimate, kinship_match), the issuer MUST hold the upstream credential.

### 4.2 Revocation Policies

- Issuers MAY revoke credentials they have issued at any time
- Revocation is immediate upon TEL `rev` event anchored in the issuer's KEL
- Revoked credentials MUST NOT be accepted by verifiers
- Revocation withdraws the attestation -- it does not delete data held by the credential holder
- Facts, research claims, and personal research graphs are never affected by credential revocation

### 4.3 Dispute Resolution

The ecosystem does not enforce disputes or impose liability. All actions are signed and attributable. Disputes are expressed as signed `dispute_claim` credentials visible in the public claim graph. Endorsements are signed `endorsement` credentials. Consensus emerges from the visible balance of disputes and endorsements. Algorithm services compute corroboration scores from this data. Individuals decide what to trust.

Duplicity (equivocation) detected by watchers constitutes evidence of bad faith. The signed audit trail provides evidence for any external proceedings, but the ecosystem itself does not adjudicate.

## 5. Infrastructure Obligations

### 5.1 Witness Pool Requirements

Roles operating witness pools (archive, record_host, certification_body, dna_service) MUST:
- Maintain a minimum of 3 geographically distributed witnesses
- Achieve KAACE consensus threshold before confirming events
- Publish OOBI endpoints for witness discovery
- Monitor witness availability and rotate failed witnesses

### 5.2 Watcher Network Requirements

Roles subscribing to watcher networks (record_host, algorithm_service) MUST:
- Sync KELs for all AIDs they interact with
- Report duplicity evidence to affected parties
- Maintain first-seen records for audit purposes

### 5.3 Agent Service Requirements

All roles run KERIA agents and MUST:
- Secure private key material (never at rest on disk unencrypted)
- Implement key rotation per their own security policy
- Maintain backup and recovery procedures
- Support the IPEX protocol for credential exchange

---

## 6. Privacy Framework

### 6.1 Disclosure Modes

- **Record Custody Credential**: full disclosure
- **Digitization Authorization**: full disclosure
- **Digitization Record**: full disclosure
- **Record Attestation**: full disclosure
- **Index Entry Credential**: full disclosure
- **Record Hosting Agreement**: full disclosure
- **Research Claim**: full disclosure
- **Identity Resolution Claim**: full disclosure
- **Source Object Link**: full disclosure
- **Professional Genealogist Certification**: selective disclosure
- **Program Accreditation**: selective disclosure
- **DNA Result Credential**: selective disclosure
- **Ethnicity Estimate**: selective disclosure
- **Kinship Match**: selective disclosure
- **Dispute Claim**: full disclosure
- **Endorsement Claim**: full disclosure

### 6.2 Data Minimization

Verifiers MUST request only the minimum credential fields required for their purpose. Selective disclosure credentials MUST be presented in compact form unless the verifier demonstrates a legitimate need for full disclosure.

### 6.3 Consent

Credential holders control presentation. No credential may be verified without the holder initiating the IPEX presentation exchange. The holder's agent MUST prompt for consent before disclosing attributes.

### 6.4 Time-Locked Disclosure

The ecosystem supports time-locked and event-triggered disclosure for sensitive records:

- Records may be sealed with conditions: "Release after all named individuals deceased for N years"
- Death verification requires a certified death record credential from a recognized source
- During the lock period, only selective disclosure is permitted (e.g., confirm existence of a record without revealing contents)
- Visibility of lock conditions creates a verification trail -- community members can contribute by verifying death records, creating incentives for collaborative research
- Lock conditions are encoded in the ACDC and enforced by the holder's agent

### 6.5 Privacy Hierarchy

Privacy decisions follow a hierarchy:

1. **Regulation** -- legal requirements override all other privacy decisions
2. **Record holder** -- archive/custodian policies constrain what can be disclosed
3. **Individual** -- people identified in records control their personal exposure

### 6.6 Living Person Protections

When a record or research claim identifies a living person, and that person holds an AID in the ecosystem, they MUST be notified. Living persons may:

- Accept the identification (consent to association)
- Dispute the identification (assert the record does not refer to them)
- Request removal (ask the claim issuer to revoke or redact)

Notification requires an identity ecosystem bridge for contact resolution.

### 6.7 Privacy Requirements

- DNA credentials use selective disclosure only -- individual controls what is revealed and to whom
- Living people are notified when identified in records and can accept, dispute, or request removal
- Time-locked disclosure: records sealed until conditions met (death records verified + time elapsed)
- Selective disclosure during lock periods -- fact of existence visible, details sealed
- Privacy hierarchy: regulation overrides record holder, record holder overrides individual
- Locked-record visibility creates verification trails and incentives for community contribution
- Facts extracted from records are not copyrightable and belong to the researcher
- Digitization expressions (photos, scans) may carry copyright controlled by the digitizer

## 7. Liability Framework

### 7.1 Ecosystem Liability

The ecosystem carries no liability. It is a protocol and set of shared schemas, not an organization or platform. There is no central operator to hold liable.

### 7.2 Individual Accountability

All actions in the ecosystem are signed by identified participants. The signed audit trail provides evidence for external legal proceedings. Participants are individually accountable for:

- The accuracy of their assertions at the time of issuance
- Compliance with applicable laws and regulations
- Honoring the terms of credentials they hold (hosting agreements, digitization authorizations)

### 7.3 Buyer Beware

Consumers of research claims, identity resolutions, and other assertions are responsible for evaluating the provenance and corroboration of claims before relying on them. The ecosystem makes provenance visible -- it does not guarantee truth.

### 7.4 Infrastructure Liability

Witness pool operators are responsible for availability and first-seen integrity. Watcher operators are responsible for timely duplicity reporting. These are operational obligations, not legal guarantees.

---

## 8. Interoperability

### Identity Ecosystem Bridge

**Bridge credentials:** individual identity verification

**Data flows:**
- Genealogy ecosystem consumes identity credentials for living person verification
- Living person notification requires identity ecosystem bridge for contact resolution
- Death record verification may originate from identity or vital records ecosystems

Cross-ecosystem credential verification requires both ecosystems to publish compatible OOBIs and recognize each other's governance frameworks. Bridge credentials MUST chain from a credential recognized in both ecosystems.

---

## 9. Data Ownership Principles

### 9.1 Facts Are Free

Facts extracted from records (names, dates, places, relationships) are not copyrightable and belong to whoever discovers them. No participant can revoke your knowledge of a fact.

### 9.2 Expressions Are Owned

Specific digitizations (photographs, scans, transcriptions) may carry copyright controlled by the digitizer or archive. Copyright terms are encoded in digitization_authorization and hosting_agreement credentials.

### 9.3 Research Is Yours

Research claims, identity resolutions, disputes, endorsements, and your personal genealogy view are signed by YOUR AID. No other participant can revoke, delete, or modify your research. The worst case is that a provenance chain breaks (an upstream attestation is revoked), but your claims and your data remain intact and portable.

### 9.4 Revocation Is About Trust, Not Deletion

When a credential is revoked, the issuer withdraws their attestation. The TEL records the revocation. But revocation does not reach into your device and delete data. Your local copies, extracted facts, and research graph are unaffected.
