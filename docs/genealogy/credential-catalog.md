## Shared Schema Definitions

The ecosystem publishes shared schema definitions for common genealogical data types. Credentials like `research_claim`, `index_entry`, and `digitization_record` reference these schemas via `schema_ref`. Schemas are not credentials -- they are infrastructure.

Planned schema types include:

- **Lifeline/Timeline** -- birth, marriage, residence, occupation, death events
- **Census Record** -- per-census-type schemas (US Federal, UK, etc.)
- **Vital Record** -- birth certificate, death certificate, marriage license
- **Church Record** -- baptism, confirmation, burial, parish registers
- **Immigration Record** -- passenger lists, naturalization, passports
- **Military Record** -- service, pension, draft registration
- **Land/Property Record** -- deeds, tax rolls, surveys
- **Document (generic)** -- structured fields for the printed form + freeform field for marginalia, annotations, and content that exceeds the form's fields

All schemas include a `freeform_content` field for information that does not fit the structured format, reflecting the reality that historical documents frequently contain valuable information outside their formal fields.

---

## Next Steps

- Run `/keri:design1-service` to design services that issue, hold, and verify these credentials.
- Credential schemas are anchored in the ecosystem's schema registry once C2 infrastructure is deployed.
