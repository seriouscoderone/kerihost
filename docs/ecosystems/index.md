description: "KERI ecosystem designs — real communities, real credentials, real architecture."
---

Ecosystem designs are conceptual architectures that map out how KERI credentials, roles, and governance work together for specific communities. Each design is a complete specification — roles, credentials, delegation trees, and interoperability — ready to be implemented. Credentials and schemas shown are illustrative examples, not finalized specifications.

These are not whitepapers. They are buildable blueprints.

### [Humanitarian Service Marketplace](/ecosystems/humanitarian-service-marketplace/)

A cross-organizational ecosystem where individuals and organizations declaratively state service needs, and credentialed volunteers contractually commit to meet those needs. Service organizations participate as peers — each credentialing and vetting volunteers according to their own governance, while service opportunities and verified service records flow freely across organizational boundaries.

### [Small Trades Cooperative](/ecosystems/small-trades-cooperative/)

A cooperative of independent skilled tradespeople where each worker holds verifiable credentials — trade licenses, insurance, bonding, safety certifications — and contracts directly with homeowners and cities. No general contractor middleman. The cooperative provides community and collective bargaining, not administrative overhead. Workers capture the full value of their labor.
