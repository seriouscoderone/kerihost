# Reputation Marketplace Design

**Type:** Design document

**Priority:** 🟣 Phase 3 (Months 12–18)

---

## Purpose

Specify how subjective, plural reputation works in practice.

## Core Principle

**No universal score.** Reputation is contextual, community-defined, algorithmically diverse.

## Outline

### Algorithm Marketplace Concept
- Multiple reputation algorithms coexist
- Communities choose which algorithms to trust
- No single "official" reputation score
- Algorithms compete on usefulness, not authority

### Bring-Your-Own-Reputation Flows
- Port reputation between communities
- Selective disclosure of reputation data
- Translation between reputation systems
- No lock-in to any single system

### Legacy Credit Ingestion as Attestations
- Traditional credit scores as one input (not the only input)
- Attestation format for external scores
- Clear provenance and limitations
- Opt-in, not required

### Native Reputation Graphs
- Build reputation from KERI interactions
- Attestation-based reputation building
- Time-weighted, decay-aware
- Community-specific weighting

### Explicit "No Universal Score" Stance
- Why universal scores are harmful
- How subjective reputation protects privacy
- The right to be judged differently in different contexts

### Community-Defined Reputation Logic
- Each community sets its own rules
- Transparent algorithms
- Opt-in participation
- Exit rights preserved
