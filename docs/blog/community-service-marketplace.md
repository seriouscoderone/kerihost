# Lifting One Another's Burdens: A KERI-Native Community Service Marketplace

**Status:** Draft outline

**Theme:** What if community service wasn't charity but contract? What if helping your neighbor was a verifiable, reciprocal, reputation-building act? A KERI OADA marketplace for community service — where lifting burdens is the economy.

## The Old Model of Help

### Charity
- Giver and receiver
- One-directional
- Often anonymous
- No accountability
- No reputation building
- Dependency, not partnership

### Informal Favors
- "I owe you one"
- Untracked, forgotten
- Imbalanced over time
- No way to verify
- Breaks down at scale

### Volunteer Organizations
- Centralized coordination
- Burnout at the top
- Gatekeeping who can help
- Limited to organized efforts
- Reputation stays with the org, not the person

None of these scale. None of these build durable community infrastructure.

## What If Help Was a Contract?

Not a legal contract. A community contract.

**Offer:** "I can help with X"
**Accept:** "I need help with X"
**Disclose:** "Here's my situation / Here's my capability"
**Attest:** "The help was received / The help was given"

Every act of service becomes:
- Verifiable
- Reciprocal (over time)
- Reputation-building
- Part of community infrastructure

## The OADA Pattern for Community Service

### Offer
"I'm offering 2 hours of yard work this Saturday."

- Who: Your AID (verifiable identity)
- What: Specific service offered
- When: Time constraints
- Where: Geographic scope
- Conditions: Any requirements

### Accept
"I accept your offer for my property."

- Matching need to offer
- Explicit agreement
- Both parties committed
- Terms clear

### Disclose
"Here's what you need to know."

- Service provider: relevant credentials, experience
- Service recipient: scope of work, access details
- Selective: only what's needed for this interaction

### Attest
"The service was completed."

- Recipient attests: work was done, quality assessment
- Provider attests: hours spent, work completed
- Both signatures: creates verifiable record
- Reputation updated: for both parties

## Sometimes It's Just a Visit

The simplest version of this is almost embarrassingly simple.

**Someone posts:** "I'd like a visitor this week."

**Someone responds:** "I'd like to visit someone this week."

That's it. That's the whole interaction.

No elaborate service description. No complex negotiation. Just:
- A person who wants company
- A person willing to give company
- A match
- A visit
- An attestation: "We visited. It was good."

### Why This Matters

Loneliness is an epidemic. Elders isolated. New parents overwhelmed. People working from home who haven't had a real conversation in days.

The barrier to asking for help is shame. "I shouldn't need this." "I don't want to be a burden."

But in a community service marketplace, asking for a visit isn't weakness — it's participation. You're creating an opportunity for someone else to contribute. You're letting them build reputation. You're part of the circulation.

**Requesting a visit is a gift to the visitor.**

### The Visit OADA

**Offer:** "I'm available to visit someone Tuesday afternoon."
**Accept:** "I'd welcome a visit Tuesday."
**Disclose:** "I'm housebound / I just like company / I make great coffee"
**Attest:** "We had a good visit." / "We had a good visit."

Both parties attest. Both build community reputation. Both gave something. Both received something.

It's that easy. It should be that easy.

## The Community Service Marketplace

### Not a Platform — A Protocol

No central operator. No fees for being "in the middle."

Just:
- A way to publish offers
- A way to find matches
- A way to verify identities and credentials
- A way to attest completion
- A way to build reputation

Anyone can run a marketplace interface. The protocol is the same.

### Types of Service

**Physical labor:**
- Yard work, home repair, moving help
- Elder care, childcare
- Transportation, errands
- Cleaning, organization

**Skills and knowledge:**
- Tutoring, mentoring
- Tax help, legal guidance
- Tech support
- Language practice

**Emotional and social:**
- Companionship visits
- Grief support
- New neighbor welcome
- Community connection

**Professional services:**
- Pro bono hours
- Reduced-rate services
- Skill sharing
- Apprenticeship

## How Reputation Works

### Earned, Not Assigned

Every completed service interaction:
- Provider gets attestation from recipient
- Recipient gets attestation from provider
- Both build verifiable track record

### Contextual, Not Universal

Your reputation for yard work ≠ your reputation for tutoring.

Communities define what matters:
- Reliability
- Quality
- Kindness
- Skill
- Availability

### Portable, Not Locked

Your service reputation travels with you:
- Move to new neighborhood → bring your track record
- Join new community → show your history
- No starting from zero

## The Economics of Mutual Aid

### Beyond Money

Not every exchange needs currency.

**Time banking:** 1 hour given = 1 hour received
**Skill exchange:** Your expertise for mine
**Pay-it-forward:** Help received → help given to someone else
**Generosity credits:** Community tracks who gives more than they take

### With Money (When Needed)

Some services need compensation:
- Professional skills
- Material costs
- Significant time investment

The marketplace supports both:
- Pure mutual aid
- Reduced-rate services
- Full compensation
- Hybrid arrangements

### The Goal: Circulation

Healthy communities circulate help.

Not: wealthy give, poor receive
But: everyone gives, everyone receives, over time

The marketplace makes this visible. Trackable. Sustainable.

## Trust Without Surveillance

### Verification Without Exposure

You can verify:
- This person completed 50 service hours
- They have 47 positive attestations
- They hold a relevant credential

Without knowing:
- Their full identity
- Their address
- Their financial situation
- Anything beyond what's needed

### Accountability Without Central Authority

Bad actors get:
- Negative attestations
- Reduced reputation
- Natural consequences

No central committee deciding who's "in" or "out."
The community's attestations speak for themselves.

---

## What This Enables

### Resilient Communities

When crisis hits:
- Needs are visible
- Capabilities are known
- Matching happens fast
- No bottleneck at a central coordinator

### Intergenerational Exchange

Elders offer: wisdom, time, experience
Youth offer: energy, tech skills, labor

Both build reputation. Both contribute. Both receive.

### Newcomer Integration

New to town?
- Offer service → meet people
- Build reputation → earn trust
- Receive help → feel belonging

No waiting for an invitation. Just start contributing.

### Sustainable Generosity

Givers don't burn out because:
- Their contributions are visible
- They receive when they need
- The system balances over time

## The Vision

A neighborhood where:
- Everyone knows what help is available
- Everyone can offer what they have
- Every act of service builds community infrastructure
- No one is just a giver or just a receiver
- Help flows like conversation — back and forth, natural, continuous

Not charity. Not obligation. Not transaction.

Covenant. Community. Contract.

Lifting one another's burdens — verifiably, sustainably, together.
