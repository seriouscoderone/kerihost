description: "What if wealth came from the strength of your relationships, not the size of your hoard?"
status: draft
theme_summary: "We've been taught that money is a thing you get — a commodity to accumulate, hoard, and compete for. But there's an older and more honest model: money as credit, created in the space between two people who trust each other. In a credit economy, you don't get wealthy by taking. You get wealthy by being someone others trust, rely on, and want to work with. MyCHIPs and KERI make this model real. The implications are civilizational."

## The Biggest Lie in Economics

Here's something they teach you so early you never think to question it:

Money is a thing.

A commodity. A substance. Something that exists in a fixed quantity, that you acquire, that you hold, that you spend. Gold, dollars, bitcoin — the form changes but the mental model stays the same. There's a pile of money somewhere. Your job is to get as much of it as possible.

This model has a name: commodity money. And it has a consequence that shapes everything: **if money is a thing to be gotten, then the economy is fundamentally about taking.**

Your gain is my loss. The pool is finite. The game is zero-sum. Every dollar in your pocket is a dollar not in mine.

And look at the world this model built. Look at the incentives it created. Look at what it rewards.

## What If Money Was a Relationship?

There's another model. It's older than commodity money, older than coins, older than banks. It's how humans actually operated for most of history before we formalized everything and forgot what we were formalizing.

Credit.

Not credit cards. Not consumer debt. Not "buy now, pay later." Those are commodity money wearing a credit costume.

Real credit. The kind that exists between two people who know each other. The kind your grandparents had with the corner store. The kind that runs through families, neighborhoods, trade networks, and communities everywhere that economists haven't managed to "modernize" yet.

Here's how it works:

I do something valuable for you. Now you owe me. Not because a bank said so. Not because there's a contract filed with a court. Because we both know it. Because our relationship carries that information. Because trust makes it real.

That's credit. That's the original money. And it has a property that commodity money doesn't:

**It's created by the relationship itself.**

No one has to mine it. No central bank has to print it. No blockchain has to mint it. Two people who trust each other can create economic value between them by the simple act of making and keeping promises.

## The Incentive Problem

Think about what commodity money incentivizes.

Accumulation. Hoarding. Competition. Extraction. The person with the biggest pile wins. You're rewarded for taking more than you give. You're rewarded for finding ways to insert yourself between other people's transactions and skimming a percentage. You're rewarded for creating scarcity — artificial or real — because scarcity drives up the price of whatever you're holding.

The incentive structure of commodity money builds a world of gatekeepers, rent-seekers, and hoarders.

Now think about what credit money incentivizes.

If your wealth is the sum of your relationships — the trust others place in you, the promises you've kept, the value you've created for real people — then the way to get wealthy is:

- Be trustworthy
- Keep your promises
- Create value for others
- Build deep, lasting relationships
- Strengthen your community

**Your wealth is your reputation. Your reputation is your relationships. Your relationships are your community.**

The incentive structure of credit money builds a world of collaborators, community builders, and people who are rewarded for being genuinely, verifiably useful to others.

Tell me which world you'd rather live in.

## This Isn't Utopian. It's Historical.

The commodity model feels natural because we grew up in it. But for most of human economic history, credit came first.

Anthropologist David Graeber documented this extensively. Before coins, before barter (which, despite the textbooks, was never how strangers traded — it was how enemies traded), there was credit. Tabs. Obligations. Relationships carrying economic weight across time.

The village didn't need currency. Everyone knew who owed what to whom. The economy was the social fabric itself.

We didn't move to commodity money because credit was broken. We moved to commodity money because empires needed to pay soldiers who were far from home, strangers operating among strangers, where relationships didn't exist. Coins solved the problem of paying people who had no community ties to the payer.

That was a reasonable solution for empires managing armies. It was never the only way to run an economy. And it came with costs we're still paying.

## MyCHIPs: Credit for the Digital Age

The problem with traditional credit networks was scale. They worked in villages where everyone knew everyone. They broke down when you needed to transact with someone outside your circle of trust.

This is the problem MyCHIPs solves.

MyCHIPs is a protocol for digital credit — real credit, not the commodity-money-in-disguise that credit cards offer. Two parties who trust each other establish a "tally" — a bilateral credit agreement. I trust you for up to X. You trust me for up to Y. Value flows between us as we create it for each other.

But here's where it gets interesting: what happens when I need to pay someone I don't directly trust?

MyCHIPs uses a "lift" protocol — a distributed credit-clearing mechanism that finds circular paths through the network. If I trust Alice, Alice trusts Bob, and Bob trusts the person I need to pay, value can flow through that chain of trust. The credits clear. No one needs a coin or a token. No one needs a bank. No one needs global consensus.

The network of trust IS the financial system.

And the lift protocol finds these paths automatically, across the entire network, settling circular obligations without any central authority coordinating it. It's elegant because it mirrors how trust actually works — through chains of relationships, not through institutions that manufacture synthetic trust for a fee.

## KERI Makes It Accountable

Traditional credit networks had another problem: accountability. How do you prove who made what promise? How do you handle disputes? How do you prevent someone from denying obligations?

This is exactly what KERI was built for.

Every participant has a KERI identifier — a self-certifying, cryptographically verifiable identity with a complete key history. Every credit agreement can be expressed as an ACDC — an Authentic Chained Data Container — signed by both parties, verifiable by anyone who needs to see it, private from everyone who doesn't.

You can't deny a promise you cryptographically signed. You can't impersonate someone whose key history is independently verifiable. You can't tamper with a record that's witnessed and receipted.

KERI doesn't replace trust. It makes trust auditable. It gives credit the accountability infrastructure it needs to work beyond the village, at internet scale, without requiring everyone to know everyone.

**MyCHIPs provides the credit protocol. KERI provides the identity and accountability layer. Together, they make relationship-based money work at scale.**

## What Changes When Money Is People

### The Wealth Equation Flips

In commodity money: wealth = what you've accumulated.
In credit money: wealth = who trusts you and why.

You can't get rich by hoarding credit. Credit only exists in relationships. A million dollars of credit from people who trust you is wealth. A million dollars of credit you've extended to people who don't pay you back is poverty. The quality of your relationships IS your financial position.

### Intermediaries Lose Their Moat

Banks, payment processors, and financial platforms profit by being trusted middlemen. They sit between people who could transact directly and charge for the privilege.

In a credit network, you don't need a middleman to create trust. You have direct relationships. The lift protocol handles settlement. ACDCs handle the contracts. KERI handles the identity. The intermediary has nothing left to sell you.

### Community Becomes Capital

In a credit economy, your community is literally your wealth. The stronger your community, the more credit flows through it, the more paths exist for the lift protocol, the more economic activity is possible.

Building community isn't a nice-to-have. It's an investment. Maybe the best investment there is.

A well-connected community with strong trust relationships is financially resilient in a way that no amount of commodity money can match. Your money can't be inflated away by a central bank, frozen by a payment processor, or devalued by a market crash. It exists in the relationships themselves, and those relationships exist because people find each other genuinely useful.

### Incentives Align with Humanity

This is the part that matters most.

Every economic system creates incentives. Those incentives shape behavior. That behavior shapes culture. That culture shapes the world.

Commodity money incentivizes: taking, hoarding, competing, extracting, inserting yourself as a middleman.

Credit money incentivizes: giving, connecting, collaborating, building trust, being genuinely valuable to real people.

We've spent centuries trying to patch the downsides of commodity money with regulations, redistribution, social safety nets, and moral exhortation. "Be generous." "Give back." "Don't be greedy." We beg people to act against their economic incentives and wonder why it doesn't work.

What if we just changed the incentives?

What if the system rewarded the behavior we actually want?

## The Hard Questions

This isn't all sunshine. Real questions need real answers.

**What about strangers?** Credit works in relationships. How do you bootstrap trust with someone new? The lift protocol helps — you can transact through chains of trust. And KERI credentials let you bring verifiable reputation into new relationships. But the cold-start problem is real.

**What about bad actors?** Someone could build trust and then betray it. Yes. This is true in every system. The difference is that in a credit network, betrayal has natural consequences — your credit relationships collapse, your reputation craters, and the network routes around you. The punishment is economic exile, enforced by the network itself, not by a court.

**What about scale?** Can credit networks handle billions of participants? MyCHIPs is designed for it — the lift protocol is distributed and doesn't require global consensus. But we don't know yet. The honest answer is that this is theoretically sound and practically unproven at internet scale.

**What about existing debt?** The world runs on commodity money. You can't just switch. Transition strategies matter. Early credit networks will likely exist alongside traditional finance, not replace it overnight.

## Where We Are

MyCHIPs is a working protocol with a specified credit-clearing algorithm. KERI is a specified, implemented identity infrastructure. ACDCs provide the contract layer.

The pieces exist.

What doesn't exist yet: the integration. The tooling. The user experience that makes this accessible to people who don't care about cryptographic protocols. The network effects that make a credit network valuable.

We're at the foundation-laying stage. It would be dishonest to pretend otherwise.

But think about what's being laid. Not another payment app. Not another fintech startup. Not another token. A fundamentally different answer to the question "what is money?" — backed by real cryptography, real protocols, and a real understanding of how trust between humans actually works.

## The Question Worth Asking

We've accepted commodity money as natural. As inevitable. As the only way money can work.

It's not. It's one design choice among many, and it's a design choice that incentivizes the worst in us.

There's another way. One that rewards building relationships over building hoards. One where your community is your capital. One where being trustworthy isn't just a virtue — it's a financial strategy.

Money is not a thing you get. Money is a promise between people. The better your promises, the stronger your relationships, the richer you are.

Not metaphorically. Actually.

*TODO: Add MyCHIPs technical deep-dive (lift protocol mechanics, tally structure, credit limits), specific examples of credit clearing in practice, comparison with hawala and other historical credit networks, exploration of how ACDC schemas would represent MyCHIPs tallies, and connection to the community service marketplace (credit for community service as literal community currency)*
