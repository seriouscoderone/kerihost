status: draft
theme_summary: "Stripe, Coinbase, and Google are racing to build payment rails for AI agents — fintech pipes, crypto pipes, ad-tech pipes. And yes, for now, those pipes are necessary because that's the plumbing the world runs on. But let's ask the harder question: why do AI agents need money at all? Money is a coordination technology. The most scalable one humans ever invented. But it coordinates with embedded values, power asymmetries, and blind spots baked in. KERI and AI offer something money never could: coordination on your terms, with your values, where community is the backbone — not currency."

## Everybody Wants to Be the Pipe

Stripe is building payment rails for AI agents. Coinbase is doing the same with crypto. Google is wiring payments into its agent ecosystem. Every major fintech and tech company is racing to answer the same question: when AI agents act on behalf of humans, how does money move?

It's a reasonable question. The world runs on money. Agents that can't pay for things are agents that can't do much. So yes — build the pipes. For now.

But there's a deeper question nobody in those boardrooms is asking.

Why do the agents need money at all?

## Money Is Coordination. That's the Good Part.

Money solves a genuine problem. Maybe the biggest coordination problem in human history: how do millions of strangers with wildly different needs, skills, and resources cooperate without anyone in charge?

Before money, you had the barter problem. I have wheat, you have shoes, but you don't need wheat right now. Money creates a universal "I owe you" that can be redeemed later, from anyone, for anything. That's a coordination breakthrough of enormous scale.

Prices extend the trick further. When oil gets expensive, thousands of unconnected actors independently decide to conserve, invest in alternatives, or explore new sources — without anyone telling them to. Hayek's whole argument was essentially this: prices coordinate distributed knowledge that no central planner could aggregate. Money is the medium through which that happens.

So far, so good. Money coordinates. Brilliantly.

## Money Is Also Control. That's the Part We Don't Talk About.

Money doesn't just *enable* coordination. It *shapes* it.

It coordinates activity toward things that are measurable and exchangeable, while systematically undervaluing things that aren't. Care work. Ecological health. Community trust. Mentorship. Showing up for your neighbor. These are the most valuable things humans do for each other, and money can't see them.

There's also a power dimension that the word "coordination" politely obscures. Those with more money can direct the behavior of those with less in ways that aren't purely voluntary. That's less "coordination" in the collaborative sense and more command with extra steps.

Money is coordination with embedded values, power dynamics, and blind spots baked in. Calling it *only* coordination risks making it sound more benign than it is.

We wrote about this in [Money Is People](/blog/2026/02/14/money-is-people/) — the commodity money model incentivizes accumulation, hoarding, and extraction. The credit model incentivizes trust, relationships, and genuine usefulness. The coordination mechanism you choose shapes the civilization you build.

## Stripe and Coinbase Are Building Better Pipes for the Same Water

The race to build agent payment rails is not about changing what money is. It's about making money move faster between machines.

Stripe's agent toolkit: fintech pipes. Agent presents a card, charges flow through existing banking infrastructure, fees get skimmed at every hop. The same [intermediary tax](/blog/2026/02/06/actual-value-economy/) wearing an AI hat.

Coinbase's approach: crypto pipes. Faster settlement, fewer intermediaries, but still denominated in tokens that behave like commodity money. The blockchain version of the same coordination mechanism with the same embedded values.

Google: ad-tech pipes. The AI agent as a new surface for the attention economy. Money moves, but the real currency is still your data and your eyeballs.

All three are building faster plumbing for a system that already knows what it values. None of them are questioning whether the system values the right things.

## What If You Could Just... Coordinate?

Here's the thought that won't leave.

Money exists because strangers needed a way to cooperate without trust. But what happens when you have trust infrastructure that works at scale?

[KERI provides verifiable identity](/blog/2026/02/11/why-digital-identity/). You know who you're dealing with — cryptographically, not because a platform vouches for them. [ACDCs provide verifiable contracts](/blog/2026/02/14/the-last-satisfying-application/) — signed agreements about who does what for whom, machine-readable, auditable, revocable.

[AI provides the coordination intelligence](/blog/2026/02/21/the-railroad-moment/). Matching needs with capacity. Scheduling. Logistics. The work that money's price signals do crudely, AI can do precisely — with context, with nuance, with awareness of things money can't measure.

Put these together and you don't need a universal "I owe you" token to coordinate activity. You need:

1. **Identity** — I know who you are (AID)
2. **Agreements** — We've agreed what we'll do for each other (ACDC)
3. **Reputation** — You've delivered before, verifiably (attested history)
4. **Intelligence** — An agent that matches, schedules, and coordinates (AI)

That's coordination without the blind spots. Coordination that can see care work, community building, ecological stewardship — because those things are attestable even when they're not priceable.

## "But You Still Need Money for Things"

Yes. Today. Absolutely.

You need money to pay your rent, buy groceries, and keep the lights on. Nobody is pretending otherwise. The world runs on money and will for a long time.

This is why Stripe and Coinbase are building what they're building. The integration layer matters. AI agents operating in today's economy need to move money through today's pipes. That's pragmatic and necessary.

But "necessary for now" and "necessary forever" are different claims.

The [community service marketplace](/blog/2026/02/08/community-service-marketplace/) we've designed doesn't need money to function. A retired carpenter helps a neighbor with a porch repair. That's attested — an ACDC signed by both parties. The carpenter's reputation grows. Next month, someone helps the carpenter with their garden. Also attested. Value flowed. Nobody paid anyone.

[MyCHIPs](/blog/2026/02/13/the-new-crypto/) shows how this scales beyond neighborhoods — credit clearing through chains of trust, where value moves through relationships, not through banking rails. Not because money is evil, but because [the network of trust IS the financial system](/blog/2026/02/14/money-is-people/).

The transition is real: you need the old pipes while you build the new ones. You don't need to pretend the old pipes are the destination.

## The UBI Question

People are worried about the future. About what happens when AI can do most of what humans currently get paid for. Elon Musk talks about Universal High Income. Others talk about Universal Basic Income. Everyone senses that the economy we have isn't going to survive contact with artificial intelligence that works for free.

They're right to worry. And they're right that something has to change.

But here's what UBI gets wrong: it assumes the problem is distribution. Not enough money reaching enough people. So print more, or tax more, and hand it out.

That's treating the symptom. The disease is that we've built a civilization where your access to the basics of life depends on being useful to a labor market that's about to not need you.

UBI says: keep the system, just add a floor.

We're saying something different: [build a new system](/blog/2026/02/06/actual-value-economy/) where value isn't determined by what a labor market will pay for your time.

In a credit economy where community is capital, your value isn't your salary. It's your relationships. Your trustworthiness. Your willingness to show up. Your skill, your care, your presence. Things that AI can't replace because they're not labor — they're humanity.

You don't need Universal Basic Income if the economy runs on what you actually contribute to the people around you, attested and verifiable, rather than on what a corporation will pay for your hours.

## The Invitation

Here's where we are.

The AI agent economy is coming. Stripe, Coinbase, and Google will build the payment pipes because that's the business they're in. And those pipes will work, for what they're designed for.

But alongside that — underneath it, around it, eventually beyond it — something else is possible.

An economy where coordination doesn't require a universal token that encodes someone else's values. Where your AI agent acts within [cryptographically scoped authority](/blog/2026/02/06/keri-ai-security-framework/) on your behalf, coordinating with other agents and other humans based on agreements you actually made. Where reputation is earned through attested delivery, not accumulated through extraction. Where community isn't a marketing buzzword but the literal backbone of economic life.

We're [designing these economies](/blog/2026/02/19/designing-keri-ecosystems-with-ai/) — one industry at a time. Trades. Genealogy. Community service. Each one a worked example of what coordination looks like when you strip away the intermediaries, the extraction, and the assumption that money is the only way strangers can cooperate.

This isn't a whitepaper. It's an invitation.

If you see a future that doesn't look like anything we've seen before — and you'd rather build something new than wait for a UBI check from the same system that's failing — [start here](/blog/2026/02/19/designing-keri-ecosystems-with-ai/). Pick an industry. Design the ecosystem. Build the rails.

Not payment rails. [Trust rails](/blog/2026/02/21/the-railroad-moment/).

Just coordinate. Just become a community. Just build.
