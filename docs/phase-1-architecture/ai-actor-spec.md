# AI as First-Class KERI Actor — Specification

**Type:** Design specification

**Priority:** 🟢 Phase 1 (Months 3–6)

---

## Purpose

Define how AI agents operate as delegated KERI participants.

## Key Positioning

*"AI that can legally and cryptographically act, not just suggest."*

## Core Concepts

### AI Agents with Delegated AIDs
- Explicit authority scope
- Time-bounded delegation
- Revocable at any time
- Auditable action history

### Non-Repudiable AI Actions
- Every action signed by agent's AID
- Delegation chain verifiable
- Principal accountable
- Agent actions attributable

## AI Capabilities

### Execute Contracts
- Sign agreements within scope
- Honor pre-defined terms
- Trigger conditional actions

### Negotiate Offers
- Propose terms within parameters
- Accept counter-offers if authorized
- Escalate when outside scope

### Perform Disclosures
- Present credentials as authorized
- Selective disclosure by policy
- Audit trail of what was shared

### Integrate Services via ACDC Schemas
- Read schema definitions
- Compose appropriate disclosures
- Establish OOBI trust
- Execute without pre-integration

## Integration-on-the-fly Pattern

1. **Read schema** — Understand what's being asked
2. **Compose disclosure** — Assemble required credentials
3. **Establish OOBI trust** — Bootstrap connection
4. **Execute** — Complete the interaction

No pre-built integrations required. AI reads the schema and figures out how to comply.

## Delegation Patterns

### Scope Limitations
- Action types allowed
- Value limits
- Time boundaries
- Counterparty restrictions

### Revocation
- Immediate effect
- No delayed propagation
- Cryptographically enforced

### Audit
- Complete action history
- Delegation chain visible
- Principal always identifiable
