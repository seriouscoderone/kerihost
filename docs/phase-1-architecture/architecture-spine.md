# KERI.host Architecture Document ("The Spine")

**Type:** Technical reference / architecture overview

**Priority:** 🟢 Phase 1 (Months 3–6)

## Purpose

Document the three-layer infrastructure that everything hangs on.

## Layer 1 — KERI Primitives

### AIDs (Autonomic Identifiers)
- Individuals
- Organizations
- Agents
- Devices

### Delegated AIDs
- AI agents with scoped authority
- Service bots
- Automated processes

### Multi-sig AIDs
- Boards and councils
- Threshold signatures
- Weighted voting

### Witnessing
- Own witnesses
- External witnesses
- Witness pools

### Watchers / Duplicity Detection
- Monitoring for inconsistencies
- Fork detection
- Accountability enforcement

## Layer 2 — Interaction Primitives

### OOBIs (Out-of-Band Introductions)
- Discovery mechanism
- Trust bootstrapping
- Service endpoints

### Event Streaming
- Key event logs
- Receipt flows
- State synchronization

### Escrowed Interactions
- Offers
- Accepts
- Disclosures

## Layer 3 — Meaning

### ACDCs (Authentic Chained Data Containers)
- Credentials
- Roles
- Permissions
- Attestations

### Schema Registries
- Credential schemas
- Semantic definitions
- Versioning

### SAIDs as Stable Semantic Anchors
- Content-addressable identifiers
- Immutable references
- Schema versioning

### Contractual Disclosure Patterns
- Selective disclosure
- Graduated disclosure
- Compliance patterns

## Key Insight

This quietly replaces:
- OAuth
- SAML
- Identity Providers
- Workflow engines
- Most integration platforms
