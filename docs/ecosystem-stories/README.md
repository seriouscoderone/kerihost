**Priority:** 🔴 Flagship stories Write First (30–60 days)

## Purpose

The heart of the content. Each story follows a consistent template so readers see themselves in the narrative.

## Story Template

1. **The People** — A community organizer, small business owner, city clerk, volunteer coordinator
2. **The Old Way** — Spreadsheets, email chains, platforms, manual audits, trust by reputation
3. **The Breaking Point** — Growth, conflict, fraud, burnout, regulation
4. **The New Pattern** — Everyone keeps their own records, agreements are explicit, authority is delegated not assumed, proof travels but control doesn't
5. **What Changed** — Less drama, less admin, more autonomy, fewer middle people

**Only after the story lands:** "This pattern is enabled by KERI."
