# Story 7c: City Permit Office

**Vertical:** Civic / Institutional

**Priority:** 🔴 Flagship — Write First

---

## The People

- Maria, a city clerk processing building permits
- Contractors submitting permit applications
- Inspectors verifying completed work
- City council members reviewing approval patterns
- An auditor investigating a corruption complaint

## The Old Way

- Applications submitted on paper or clunky web forms
- Contractor licenses verified by manual lookup
- Approvals tracked in a legacy database
- Inspections scheduled by phone, results filed in folders
- Audits require pulling boxes from storage

## The Breaking Point

- A contractor claims approval they never received
- An inspector is accused of favoritism
- The database crashes, losing three months of records
- An audit takes six months because records are scattered
- Public trust erodes after a permit scandal

## The New Pattern

- Contractors submit applications with verifiable credentials attached
- Each approval is a signed attestation by the responsible clerk
- Inspection results are attested by the inspector's identifier
- Every action is independently verifiable without central access
- Auditors reconstruct the entire process from public records

## What Changed

- Maria processes permits; the system proves her work
- Contractors can prove their approvals independently
- Inspectors' records are tamper-evident
- Audits take hours, not months
- Corruption becomes detectable, not just suspected

**This pattern is enabled by KERI.**
