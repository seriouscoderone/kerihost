# Phase 2 — Ecosystem Demonstrators

**Timeline:** Months 6–12

**Priority:** 🔵 Phase 2

---

## Purpose

Structurally identical to production — flight simulators, not PowerPoints.

## Five Deep Demo Specifications

| Demo | Focus | File |
|------|-------|------|
| Municipality | Permits + procurement | [demo-municipality.md](./demo-municipality.md) |
| Trades / Blue Collar | Certs + jobs | [demo-trades.md](./demo-trades.md) |
| University | Credentials | [demo-university.md](./demo-university.md) |
| Service Org | Volunteers | [demo-service-org.md](./demo-service-org.md) |
| KERI Commerce | Merchant flows | [demo-commerce.md](./demo-commerce.md) |

## Each Demo Spec Includes

- Repository structure
- Architecture diagram
- Trust boundaries
- Failure modes
- Regulator/auditor view
- "What breaks if centralized" comparison

## Demo Principles

1. **Legally plausible** — Could be used in production with real data
2. **Structurally identical** — Same architecture as production deployment
3. **Swappable endpoints** — Switch from demo to real services without code changes
4. **Self-contained** — Runnable without KERI.host infrastructure
5. **Educational** — Teaches patterns, not just showcases features
