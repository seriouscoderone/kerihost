**Type:** Positioning page

**Priority:** ⚪ Ongoing/Flexible (Phase 0–1)

---

## Purpose

Very explicit, very humble description of what KERI.host provides.

## Outline

### What We Are

- **A reference library** — Patterns you can copy, fork, and adapt
- **A storytelling hub** — Narratives that help people see themselves in the technology
- **A place to learn patterns** — Not a curriculum, but a collection of worked examples
- **Optional infrastructure** — Services you can use if helpful, ignore if not

### What We Provide

- Reference implementations (witness, watcher, controller)
- Documentation and patterns
- Ecosystem stories
- Community coordination (not control)

### What We Will Never Be

- A required dependency
- A certification authority
- A gatekeeper
- A platform

### Our Measure of Success

Not how many people use KERI.host, but how many people *don't need* KERI.host.
