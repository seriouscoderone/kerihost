## Why This Exists

Communities are built on trust.
But trust does not scale well.

As communities grow, we introduce tools to help: platforms, workflows, intermediaries, authorities.
Over time, those tools stop helping and start owning the community itself.

KERI.host exists to explore a different path:
communities that can grow without giving up their autonomy,
and economies that can coordinate without becoming extractive.

This is not about technology for its own sake.
It's about helping humans work together without losing control of what they've built.

## Why Now

We are entering a world shaped by AI.

AI will accelerate everything:
- decision-making
- coordination
- enforcement
- automation

But acceleration without accountability doesn't create trust — it destroys it.

At the same time, people are rediscovering the value of local, real, human communities:
- neighborhoods
- cooperatives
- small businesses
- mutual aid
- cities trying to modernize without becoming surveillance machines

We need infrastructure that:
- allows AI to act only with explicit authority
- allows communities to set their own rules
- creates accountability without centralized control

This moment won't wait.
If we don't build this intentionally, it will be built for us — badly.

## What We Refuse to Become

KERI.host is not a platform.

We will not:
- own your identity
- gatekeep participation
- define global reputation
- enforce a single governance model
- extract value simply for being "in the middle"

We do not believe communities need another authority.
They need better tools for accountability and cooperation.

If KERI.host ever becomes something you can't leave, we've failed.

## Cooperation Over Competition

Most systems scale by competing for control.

KERI.host is built on a different assumption:
cooperation works better when no one has unilateral power.

We believe:
- many ecosystems should exist, not one
- communities should be able to interoperate without merging
- disagreement is healthy
- pluralism is a feature, not a bug

There is no "official" ecosystem.
There is no winner-takes-all.
There is only shared infrastructure and shared learning.

## Economics Without Extraction

Healthy economies reward contribution, not position.

Too many modern systems generate profit by:
- capturing data
- locking in users
- inserting themselves as permanent intermediaries

KERI.host supports an economy where:
- value flows to those doing the work
- intermediaries must earn their place continuously
- infrastructure sustains itself without exploiting its users

We aim to be small, durable, and boring —
not dominant, aggressive, or indispensable.

## What This Is

KERI.host is:
- a place to share patterns
- a library of stories
- a set of reference ideas
- optional infrastructure for those who want it

It is an experiment in how communities, economies, and institutions could work better.

Take what's useful.
Fork what you like.
Ignore the rest.

That's the point.
